# trading-algorithm

The trading algorithms within this repository are my coursework assignments from an online course: Python and Statistics for Financial Analysis by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). These algorithms utilize the Pandas module and are written in Python 3. 
The online course can be found on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-statistics-financial-analysis/).
